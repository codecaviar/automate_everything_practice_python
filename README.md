# Automate Everything: Python Practice Problems

## Project Overview

Python is one of the most popular programming languages on the planet. It's embraced by developers, data scientists, software engineers, and even hackers because of its versatility, flexibility, and object-oriented features.

**The goal of this project is** to provide practice problems in conjunction with the *Automate Everything* series from @codecaviar.  

* Fill each function stub according to the docstring.
* When there **is not** a separate test file for the question and answer combination, run the tests with the doctest command:
`python3 -m doctest [filename]_q.py -v`
* When there **is** a separate test file for the question and answer combination, run the tests using the unit test command:
`python3 [filename]_test.py`
